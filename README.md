# Interpol Red Notice Criminal Data Scraper

## This project aims to scrape all data of all criminals which Interpol have shared publicly as Red Notice.

## Criminals are being updated day-to-day.

## Once the script is runned, tables are being created. For every further run, tables are being updated with respect to data that has been scraped from https://www.interpol.int/en/How-we-work/Notices/View-Red-Notices.
