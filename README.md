# Interpol Red Notice Criminal Data Scraper

## This project aims to scrape all data of all criminals which Interpol have shared publicly as Red Notice.

<br>

## Criminals are updating day-to-day.

## Once the script runned, tables are created. For every further runs, tables are being updated with respect to data from https://www.interpol.int/en/How-we-work/Notices/View-Red-Notices.
